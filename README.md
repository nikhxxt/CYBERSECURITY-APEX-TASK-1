Notes on naming conventions used above

* Use `Pascal_Case` (or `Title_Case`) for filenames with underscores between words ‚Äî this avoids spaces and keeps names readable.
* Fix the typo `Exceution` ‚Üí `Execution`.
* Make `LAB_SETUP_AND_TOOL_VERIFICATION.md` all-caps with underscores so it‚Äôs consistent and easy to reference.
* `Metasploitable2` without a space is common; either `Metasploitable_2` or `Metasploitable2` ‚Äî chosen `Metasploitable2_Setup.png`.

Run these commands (from your repo root) to rename files to the standardized names and commit the change:

```bash
# 1) Rename files (adjust only if paths differ)
git mv "SCREENSHOTS/Burpsuite Exceution.png" "SCREENSHOTS/BurpSuite_Execution.png"
git mv "SCREENSHOTS/Kali Linux Setup.jpg" "SCREENSHOTS/Kali_Linux_Setup.jpg"
git mv "SCREENSHOTS/Kali Linux nmap Result.jpg" "SCREENSHOTS/Kali_Linux_Nmap_Result.jpg"
git mv "SCREENSHOTS/Metasploitable 2 Setup.png" "SCREENSHOTS/Metasploitable2_Setup.png"
git mv "SCREENSHOTS/Oracle VirtualBox Setup.png" "SCREENSHOTS/Oracle_VirtualBox_Setup.png"
git mv "SCREENSHOTS/Wireshark Ping Execution.jpg" "SCREENSHOTS/Wireshark_Ping_Execution.jpg"

git mv "FOUNDATION/LAB SETUP AND TOOL VERIFICATION.md" "FOUNDATION/LAB_SETUP_AND_TOOL_VERIFICATION.md"

# 2) Add any new/renamed files to git index and remove old names (git mv already does this)
git add -A

# 3) Commit
git commit -m "Standardize filenames and fix typos: screenshots + lab report"

# 4) Push to origin (assuming branch is main)
git push origin main
```

Optional: Create a `.gitignore` (recommended content)

```
# macOS
.DS_Store

# Logs
*.log

# Packet captures or large binaries you don't want in repo
*.pcap
*.mp4      # if you prefer hosting video elsewhere; keep only if you want video in repo

# Python / node envs if any
venv/

# Temporary files

```

## ‚úÖ Quick Verification (How to reproduce)

> Host‚Äëonly subnet example used for the lab: `192.168.56.0/24`

**Example static IP plan**

* Host (VBox host‚Äëonly): `192.168.56.1`
* Kali (attacker): `192.168.56.101`
* Metasploitable (target): `192.168.56.102`

**Basic verification commands (run on Kali)**

```bash
# show interface and IP
ip a

# ping the target
ping -c 4 192.168.56.102

# basic TCP SYN nmap scan (requires sudo)
sudo nmap -sS -Pn 192.168.56.102

# capture a small packet trace (tshark) - CLI
sudo tshark -i eth0 -c 50 -w /tmp/capture.pcap
```

---

## üß∞ Commands & Examples (short cheatsheet)

* `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y` ‚Äî update Kali packages.
* `sudo apt install nmap wireshark tshark -y` ‚Äî install common tools.
* `nmap -sS -Pn <target-ip>` ‚Äî stealth SYN scan (use responsibly).
* `tshark -i eth0 -c 100 -w capture.pcap` ‚Äî capture 100 packets to a pcap file.
* `curl -I http://<target-ip>` ‚Äî check HTTP headers.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Safety & Responsible Use

This lab is for **educational, legal, and ethical** use only.

* **Do not** run attacks, scans, or exploit code against systems you do not own or do not have explicit permission to test.
* **Isolate your lab**: keep the attacker and target VMs in a host‚Äëonly or NAT network that is not bridged to your production or home network.
* Avoid connecting intentionally vulnerable VMs to the Internet.
* Keep snapshots of your VMs before major changes so you can quickly restore a clean state.
