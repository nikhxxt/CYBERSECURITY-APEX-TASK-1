# CYBERSECURITY-APEX-TASK-1
# üõ°Ô∏è Cybersecurity Foundation & Environment Setup

This repository documents **Task-1: Foundation & Environment Setup** of my cybersecurity learning journey.  
The goal is to build strong fundamentals in **cybersecurity, networking, cryptography**, and set up a professional hacking lab.

## üìå Objectives
- Build strong fundamentals in **Cybersecurity & Networking**
- Learn about **CIA Triad, Attack Vectors, Threats**
- Set up a **Kali Linux-based hacking lab**
- Explore basics of **Linux, Cryptography, and Tools**

## ‚ö° Steps Covered
1. **Cybersecurity Basics**
   - CIA Triad: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability
   - Types of Threats: Phishing, Malware, DoS, SQL Injection, Ransomware
   - Attack Vectors: Social Engineering, Wireless Attacks, Insider Threats  

2. **Lab Environment Setup**
   - VirtualBox/VMware installation
   - Kali Linux attacker machine
   - DVWA / Metasploitable2 target machines
   - Private Lab Network (Host-Only Adapter)  

3. **Linux Fundamentals**
   - File system navigation, permissions, package management
   - Networking commands (ifconfig, ping, netstat, traceroute)

4. **Networking Basics**
   - OSI & TCP/IP Models
   - DNS, HTTP/HTTPS deep dive
   - IP Addressing, Subnetting, NAT

5. **Cryptography Basics**
   - Symmetric vs Asymmetric Encryption
   - Hashing (MD5, SHA256)
   - SSL/TLS & Certificates
   - Encrypt/Decrypt with OpenSSL

6. **Tool Familiarization**
   - Wireshark (packet capture)
   - Nmap (network scanning)
   - Burp Suite (web proxy)

## Deliverables & purpose
