## üìå Objectives
- Build fundamentals in **Cybersecurity & Networking**  
- Learn: **CIA Triad, Threats, Attack Vectors**  
- Set up a **Kali Linux** attacker VM, and vulnerable targets (DVWA / Metasploitable2)  
- Become familiar with basic **Linux**, **cryptography**, and essential tools (Nmap, Wireshark, Burp)

## ‚ö° Steps Covered
1. **Cybersecurity Basics** ‚Äî CIA Triad, Threat Types, Attack Vectors  
2. **Lab Environment Setup** ‚Äî VirtualBox, Kali (attacker), Metasploitable2 / DVWA (targets), Host‚ÄëOnly network  
3. **Linux Fundamentals** ‚Äî navigation, permissions, packages, networking commands  
4. **Networking** ‚Äî OSI/TCP‚ÄëIP, DNS, HTTP/HTTPS, IP addressing & subnetting  
5. **Cryptography** ‚Äî symmetric/asymmetric, hashing, SSL/TLS, OpenSSL examples  
6. **Tools** ‚Äî Wireshark, Nmap, Burp Suite, Netcat

## ‚úÖ Quick Verification (How to reproduce)
> Use the Host‚ÄëOnly network `192.168.56.0/24` (example). Replace IPs if you chose different ones.

**Example static IP plan**
- Host (VBox host-only): `192.168.56.1`  
- Kali (attacker): `192.168.56.101`  
- Metasploitable (target): `192.168.56.102`

**Commands to verify (run on Kali)**
```bash
# show interface and IP
ip a

# ping target
ping -c 4 192.168.56.102

# basic nmap scan
sudo nmap -sS -Pn 192.168.56.102

# capture a small packet trace (tshark) - CLI
sudo tshark -i eth0 -c 50 -w /tmp/capture.pcap
````

**Expected results**

* `ping` replies from `192.168.56.102`.
* `nmap` shows open services on the target (e.g., ports 22, 80, 445 etc. depending on the target image).
* `capture.pcap` contains ICMP and TCP frames that can be opened in Wireshark.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Safety & Responsible Use

This lab is for **educational, legal, and ethical** use only.
**Do not** run attacks or scans against systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test. Use only your private VM lab or sanctioned targets.
