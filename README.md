## üìå Objectives

* Build strong fundamentals in **cybersecurity and networking**.
* Gain hands‚Äëon experience with a private Kali Linux attacker VM and intentionally vulnerable targets (DVWA / Metasploitable2).
* Become familiar with basic **Linux**, **cryptography**, and essential tools (Nmap, Wireshark, Burp Suite).
* Learn safe, responsible lab practices for ethical security learning.

---

## ‚ö° Steps Covered

1. **Cybersecurity Basics** ‚Äî CIA Triad, threat types, common attack vectors.
2. **Lab Environment Setup** ‚Äî VirtualBox setup, Kali (attacker), Metasploitable2 / DVWA (targets), Host‚ÄëOnly networking.
3. **Linux Fundamentals** ‚Äî shell navigation, file permissions, package management, basic networking commands.
4. **Networking** ‚Äî OSI/TCP‚ÄëIP model, DNS, HTTP/HTTPS, IP addressing & subnetting.
5. **Cryptography** ‚Äî symmetric vs asymmetric cryptography, hashing, SSL/TLS basics, OpenSSL examples.
6. **Tools** ‚Äî practical hands‚Äëon with Wireshark, Nmap, Burp Suite, Netcat, and Tshark.

## ‚úÖ Quick Verification (How to reproduce)

> Host‚Äëonly subnet example used for the lab: `192.168.56.0/24`

**Example static IP plan**

* Host (VBox host‚Äëonly): `192.168.56.1`
* Kali (attacker): `192.168.56.101`
* Metasploitable (target): `192.168.56.102`

**Basic verification commands (run on Kali)**

```bash
# show interface and IP
ip a

# ping the target
ping -c 4 192.168.56.102

# basic TCP SYN nmap scan (requires sudo)
sudo nmap -sS -Pn 192.168.56.102

# capture a small packet trace (tshark) - CLI
sudo tshark -i eth0 -c 50 -w /tmp/capture.pcap
```

---

## üß∞ Commands & Examples (short cheatsheet)

* `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y` ‚Äî update Kali packages.
* `sudo apt install nmap wireshark tshark -y` ‚Äî install common tools.
* `nmap -sS -Pn <target-ip>` ‚Äî stealth SYN scan (use responsibly).
* `tshark -i eth0 -c 100 -w capture.pcap` ‚Äî capture 100 packets to a pcap file.
* `curl -I http://<target-ip>` ‚Äî check HTTP headers.

---

## üìù Key Learnings / Summary

* Gained hands‚Äëon experience setting up a contained penetration‚Äëtesting lab using VirtualBox host‚Äëonly networking.
* Practiced network discovery and basic service enumeration with Nmap.
* Collected and analyzed packet captures with Tshark/Wireshark to understand network behavior.
* Reviewed fundamental cryptography concepts and practiced with OpenSSL for basic certificate and hashing exercises.
* Reinforced the importance of responsible and ethical practices when experimenting with security tools.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Safety & Responsible Use

This lab is for **educational, legal, and ethical** use only.

* **Do not** run attacks, scans, or exploit code against systems you do not own or do not have explicit permission to test.
* **Isolate your lab**: keep the attacker and target VMs in a host‚Äëonly or NAT network that is not bridged to your production or home network.
* Avoid connecting intentionally vulnerable VMs to the Internet.
* Keep snapshots of your VMs before major changes so you can quickly restore a clean state.
